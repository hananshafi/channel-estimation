# channel-estimation
Python code for estimating Channel parameter in Cognitive Radio using Least Squares Channel Estimation.

‘H’ parameter in wireless communication system presents the sum total of all the factors inﬂuencing the input signal when it travels from source to receiver. So to get the original sent input, I ahve used Machine Learning technique of Least Squares Estimation to estimate ‘H’ parameter.

In this code, we have mathematically modeled Sender, Receiver and the channel connecting the sender and receiver. Sample inputs from sender are sent to receiever. The H parameter is added to the input signals while travelling through the channel.

## Working Mechanism
